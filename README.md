# Paper-Asymptotic-Dispersion
Density-driven flow (DDF) models consider constant dispersion coefficients. Recent studies showed that dispersivity is distance-dependent. 
We investigate the effect of distance-dependent dispersion on DDF processes for cases involving sweater intrusion and leachate transport.
Variable dispersivity plays a significant role on contaminant distribution and total contamination fluxes to aquifers.  

We provide the data used to generate figures discussed in the paper
